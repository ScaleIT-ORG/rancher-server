#Rancher Server

##Getting started:
1. Change .env.dafault to .env and run "docker-compose up" in the current directory.
2. In Rancher, go to Admin -> Settings and update the Host Registration with the updated URL
    for Rancher server. Please note that it must include the exposed port that you started
 Rancher server with 
(https://docs.rancher.com/rancher/v1.2/en/faqs/server/#what-happens-if-the-ip-of-rancher-server
-has-changed).
3. (On First Start on new Machine) Copy Rancher Token to .env file
4. Run in Terminal "docker-compose stop" and "docker-compose up"

##Backup: 

In order to provide backups for rancher server, one needs to copy the directory with mysql DB (./serverdb). One possible strategy to do this: 
1. Open the directory with rancher server - "cd /srv/container-management/rancher_elk" 
2. Stop all containers to be able to safely copy server's DB - "docker-compose stop"
3. Copy the DB files in some backup-directory "cp -rf ./serverdb <some backup directory>"
4. Now set the UID/GID for the folder so that the mysql user within the container has the correct ownership of the mysql mount: "chown -R 102:105 <some backup directory>"
5. Set <some backup directory> in volumes of docker-compose.yml file: "nano docker-compose.yml"->services->rancher_server->volumes: change line "- /old/directory/serverdb:/var/lib/mysql" to 
"- <some backup directory>/serverdb:/var/lib/mysql"
6. Save changes and run "docker-compose up"
